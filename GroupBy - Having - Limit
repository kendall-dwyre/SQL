-- Explanation:
-- 1. SELECT: Specifies the columns to include in the result set. We are selecting the product_category, the total sales amount (total_sales), and the count of orders (total_orders).
-- 2. FROM: Indicates the table to query data from, which in this case is the 'orders' table.
-- 3. WHERE: Filters the rows to include only those where the order_date is between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023.
-- 4. GROUP BY: Groups the results by the product_category. This means we aggregate the data for each product category separately.
-- 5. HAVING: Filters the grouped results to include only those groups (product categories) where the total sales amount is greater than $100,000.
-- 6. ORDER BY: Orders the results by the total_sales column in descending order, so the product categories with the highest total sales come first.
-- 7. LIMIT: Limits the result set to only the top 5 product categories based on the criteria specified.
